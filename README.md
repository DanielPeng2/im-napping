# I'm Napping
An SMS auto-reply app designed for people who nap so frequently that their friends often question if they are still alive. This app will auto-reply to your friends' texts and let them know that you are still alive.

## Things I learned

 - This was my first time developing in Android using exclusively Kotlin. Was able to use some neat language features and cut down a lot on a lot of boilerplate code (thank you lambda expressions).
 
 - Developed in MVP architecture. Had some trouble such as deciding when code was supposed to belong or trying to decouple the presenter from the Android SDK. Learned about good practices such as dependency injection and gained a much stronger grasp of MVP.
 
 - Took advantage of some of the newly released Android Jetpack components. Looking foward to using more of these in the future.
